# A basic web scraper using python
To put it short, this is to practice web scraping a wikipedia page to create a dictionary.
This one was created to scrape wikipedia's "List of Gundams" page to create a dictionary and using hashcat to figure out md5 hashes.

## To do
- make the script work to open and use hashcat to output the cracekd hashes.
